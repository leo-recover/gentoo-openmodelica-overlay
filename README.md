# gentoo-openmodelica-overlay

This is my personal overlay for the OpenModelica simulation suite.  
Currently the openmodelica-1.13.2 ebuild does not compile the libraries, since the way the libraries are built requires the build system to download sources at compile time, which is not allowed on Gentoo.

## To-Do list  
- Complete dependencies 
- Add use flags
